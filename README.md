For this Bootcamp Module 5 challenge, we were tasked with creating a calendar application by modifying [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/crispy-octo-meme) & using day.js. [You betta werk (schedule)](acst52.github.io/Werk-Sched/)! The following gif demonstrates the application functionality and links to the werk sched, deployed on GitHub Pages:
